# Current Account

Current account measures net imports and exports of a country. Imports and exports are divided into three sub categories -(a)Trade of goods, (b) Trade of services and (c) Income,
  
which includes the interest and dividend payed to international firms operating within home country and interest and dividends earned from domestically owned firms abroad (krugman2006international).

The current account balance is the difference between export and import. When export of a country exceed its import, there is current account surplus and when import exceed export there is a current account deficit.

\begin{equation}
  
\text{Current Account}=\text{Total Exports}-\text{Total Imports}
  
\end{equation}

Above equation can also be expressed as a form of income and expenditure like in equation-(curAccBal2) which is the difference between Total National Income and Total Domestic consumption (krugman2006international).

\begin{equation}
  
\label{eq:curAccBal2}
  
\text{Current Account Balance}=
  
\underbrace{\text{Y}}_\text{GNP}-
  
\underbrace{\left(\text{C}+\text{I}+\text{G}\right)}_{\substack{\text{Total Domestic}\\\text{Consumption}}}
  
\end{equation}

Current account incorporates a wide range of international transactions so there is a vital role of exchange rate in each of those transaction. This thesis has considered the monthly data for imports and exports of goods which is available from [Statistics Norway][1]. In Norway, current balance is highly influence by the balance in goods. Figure-(fig:curBal) shows that the balance in services in Norway is decreasing while the balance in Goods has boost up after around 1998. Further, the balance in services plotted in the same figure from the quarterly data exhibit a seasonal trend which is usual in Norway.
