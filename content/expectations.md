### Expectations ###

Response to new information in foreign exchange market is similar to other financial market. The current expectation for the future value is reflected in the exchange rate changes. Like in stock market, when a company publishes its prosperous financial statement, the stock price suddenly rises; the forex market also exhibit similar performance. For example, a news of increasing inflation in Norway cause currency traders to sell Norwegian Krone expecting a decrease in its future value. This expectation is immediately seen as a downward pressure on Norwegian Krone. The similar effect is obtained when speculator expects the currency to depreciate (madura2012international).
