## Factors influencing Exchange Rate ##

The demand of any currency relative to its supply determines its price, just like any other commodity. For each possible price of a Norwegian Krone, there is a corresponding demand and supply to be exchanged with euro in the money market. When demand of krone equals its supply, the price it exhibit at some specific time is called its equilibrium exchange rate. Factors like inflation, interest rates, expectation and government policy affects the demand for any currency. But the supply is mostly in control of the central bank. In a floating exchange rate regime, the shift in demand (fig-fig:demandShift) and supply(fig-fig:supplyShift) function determines equilibrium exchange rate of any currency.

    Effect of shifts on demand and supply of currencies on their Exchange rates

In case of demand shift, with constant currency supply, the exchange rate will suddenly rise to \(eâ€™_d\) creating dead weight loss (also known as [excess burden or allocative inefficiency][1] which consequently pushes the supply from \(Q\_0\) to \(Q\_1\) creating a new equilibrium exchange rate at \(e\_1\). In the similar fashion, if the market is over flooded with currency, shifting the supply function and creating dead weight loss, the exchange rate is pressed from \(e\_0\) to create a new equilibrium at \(e_1\). In both the situation, the quantity supplied although being increased, the first one leads to a rise in exchange rate while the other leads to its fall.

madura2012international suggested an equation consisting those macroeconomic factors that can affect the demand and supply of any currency and consequently the exchange rate as,

\begin{equation}
\text{e} = f \left(\Delta \text{INF}, \Delta \text{INT}, \Delta \text{INC}, \Delta \text{GC}, \Delta \text{EXP}\right)
\end{equation}

where,
