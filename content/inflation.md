### Inflation ###

Inflation is the steady rise in overall price level, i.e. a decrease in the value of currency. In other words, more amount of money is needed to buy same goods than previous. Relative change in inflation has effect on exchange rate. For instance, an abrupt rise in the inflation in Norway relative to the Eurozone, Norwegian products becomes relatively expensive in terms of Norwegian Currency. On one hand, this would increase the demands for Eurozone goods, and consequently the demand for euro increases in the short run. On the other hand, expensive Norwegian goods becomes less attractive in Eurozone and therefore reduce the supply of euro purchasing Norwegian kroner. In figure &#8211; fig:inflationEffect, the demand function of Euro shift upward due to inflation of NOK, i.e. Eurozone goods are more attractive than Norwegian goods and the downward shift on supply function occurs as the customers are less interested in Norwegian products. As a result the value of Euro per NOK increases from 9.10 to 9.97, i.e Norwegian Krone deprecates against the Euro (madura2012international).<figure id="attachment_73" style="width: 396px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Statistics Norway prepares and publishes the official figures for inflation, the consumer price index (CPI) with base year at 1998. Since the real value of money is constantly declining, high inflation means that storing money is expensive. while low and stable inflation contributes to an efficient distribution of resources in a market economy (NorgesBank2007faq). Since this is an important factor that can influence exchange rate, data for CPI is obtained for this thesis from Norges bank. The time-series plot for CPI in figure-fig:tsCPI shows an steady increment over the time.
