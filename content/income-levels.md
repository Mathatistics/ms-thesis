### Income Levels ###

The rise in real income level increases the consumption level. Relative income levels of a country is another factor which can affect the demand of imported goods which consequently affect exchange rate (madura2012international). For instance, if the income levels of people of euro zone rises, other factor being constant, the demand for foreign goods in euro zone may increase which can shift the demand function outward and subsequently increase the exchange rate (figure-fig:incEffect).<figure id="attachment_87" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The example considered above is on the assumption of _ceteris paribus_, which in reality is not usual. The change in exchange rate due to income levels is also guided through the effect of income levels on interest rates and inflation. The increased income levels increase the consumption cause the economy to overheat. Central banks could increase interest rates to prevent overheating and increased inflation. Thus the relative change in income levels can affect exchange rates directly and indirectly (madura2012international).
