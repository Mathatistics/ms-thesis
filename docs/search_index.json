["index.html", "Evaluation of Models for predicting the average monthly Euro versus Norwegian krone exchange rate from financial and commodity information Abstract", " Evaluation of Models for predicting the average monthly Euro versus Norwegian krone exchange rate from financial and commodity information Raju Rimal Abstract Many multinational companies and policy makers carry out decisions by speculating exchange rate. Exchange rate is determined by the demand and supply of a currency. It depends highly on variables like imports, exports, interest rates, oil prices, inflation and even with its past values. Since these macroeconomic variables are highly correlated with each other, latent variables or principal components can solve the problem of multicollinearity. The application of latent variables and prin- cipal components based methods such as Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Partial Least Square (PLS) in time series data for prediction is uncommon. Prediction of exchange rate of Norwegian Krone per Euro using Multiple linear re- gression, Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Partial Least Square (PLS) regression is performed in this dissertation. Linear models and its subsets obtained using criteria such as minimum AIC or BIC and maximum R2adj are compared on the basis of their goodness of fit. The selected model is then compared with models from principal component regression and partial least square regression on the basis of predictability criteria of RMSEP and R2 predicted. The results have suggested the partial least square regression as the best models among other. The residuals obtained from the models have no au- tocorrelations so the application of this method has not only reduced the dimension of data but also resolved the problem of multicollinearity and autocorrelations.

["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Apart from having distinct role in money market, exchange rate has influence in almost all the sectors of economics and finance. Understanding its dynamics enables multinational companies to make decision on their investment and assist bureaucrats to update the monetary and fiscal policies. Different models are used to understand the dynamics of exchange rate, however the use of latent variable in the models is unconventional. Multicollinearity which is also a common problem in economic researches, models based on principal components (latent variables) such as Principal Component Regression(PCR) and Partial Least Square(PLS) regression can resolve the problem. Although autocorrelation is a major problem in time-series, inclusion of the past values of dependent variable in the model can solve the problem in many situations. In this dissertation the exchange rate of Norwegian Krone vs Euro is predicted from the classical linear regression models, its subsets derived from various criteria, PCR and PLS models. The models are compared on the basis of their performance. Under proper model specification and wise selection of required components, Principal Component Regression and Partial Least Square regression can forecast better than the linear models. Trading has started from the very beginning of human civilization. People used to trade with goods at the time but with advancement of development people started using gold, silver and finally money. The process is not restricted within a country. Some countries are powerful and some are not so as their currencies. Currency of another country becomes essential to buy things from that country. Here comes the role of exchange rate. Buying powerful currencies requires large sum of weak currencies. Any international trade is conducted through more than one currencies. Participants in the international trade require to exchange their currency which is performed by foreign exchange market. “The foreign exchange market (ForEx) is the mechanism that brings together buyers and sellers of different currencies” (appleyard2014international). As any other commodity, exchange rate is also determined from its demand and supply in money market. All those economic activities that exist between countries create demand and supply of the currencies which consequently determine the exchange rate. The economic activities between countries are recorded as balance of payment account. Thus the balance of payment account captures all the demand and supply of foreign currency (fang1991forecasting). When the domestic demand for foreign currency exceeds the foreign demand of domestic currency i.e. a deficit in the balance of payment, the domestic currency depreciate (sur2005). Foreign currencies are involved in various activities such as, a) imports and exports of goods and services, b) interest and dividends payed to foreign investment in domestic market, c) interest and dividends earned from investments made on foreign market, d) all the currencies that enter into and leave from a country as income and expenditure. Three factors affecting exchange rate are considered in this thesis. Primarily, total monthly imports and exports of goods are considered. Ships, oil platform, chemicals and food stuffs are major imports of Norway. Petroleum products, machinery, equipment, chemicals and fishes are the major exports. Since the economy of Norway highly depend on petroleum products, apart from imports and exports, the second component considered is the spot oil price. Third factor is the financial variables such as interest rate and consumer price index are considered. In interest rate – a) key interest rate of Norway, b) Loan interest rate c) key interest rate of euro area are taken into account as factors affecting interest rate. "],
["methods-opted-for-analysis.html", "Methods opted for analysis", " Methods opted for analysis Univariate time series analysis is very common in Econometric where Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA) and Autoregressive integrated Moving average (ARIMA) are used. However, dealing a time series data with many predictor variables using latent variables and principal components methods is unconventional. This thesis aims to analysis a time series with financial and commodity data, as predictor, using statistical regression methods such as – Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Partial Least Square (PLS) Regression. Apart from these, a subset models which selected from the Multiparty Linear Regression using various criteria are also used. An application of PCR and PLS on time series data makes this thesis distinct. "],

["forex-market.html", "ForEx Market", " ForEx Market Foreign Exchange(Fx) Market is the most traded and liquid financial market where individuals, firms and banks buy and sell foreign currencies. Forex market constitute of monetary counters connected electronically which are in constant contact forming a single international financial market. The market remains open 24 hr a day for five working days of a week (fxIntro). Currencies are exchanged for activities like trade, tourism and investments in another countries. For instance, a person visiting France needs euro since euro is accepted in France. On returning back from the visit (s)he might want to exchange back those Euros to Norwegian Krone. This transaction is affected by the exchange rate of Norwegian Krone per Euro. The exchange rate of NOK per Euro over time is plotted in figure-(fig:tsPerEUROPlot). Exchange rate can be set according to different macroeconomic variables, such as interest rate, price index, balance of payment etc. Such exchange rate determined by ForEx market transaction is called Floating exchange rate. Some country fix exchange rate while others pegged with other currency. Norway has a floating exchange rate. The Norwegian krone (NOK) After introduction of Krone in April 1875 (NorBnkHistory), Norway was pushed to join the Scandinavian Monetary Union established on 1873 (nokHistoryOanda). Although the Union was formally abolished on 1972, Norway decided to keep the names of its currencies. In December 1982, due to heavy speculation, Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway) decided to fix Norwegian Krone which later floated on 1992 (NorBnkHistory). EURO Euro, the official currency in the Eurozone, was introduced as a virtual currency in 1999 and later as physical in 2002. It is the single currency shared by 19 of the European Union’s Member States of Euro Area. Although European Central Bank (ECB) manages Euro, the fiscal policy (public revenue and expenditure) are in the hands of individual national authorities. The single currency market throughout the euro zone not only makes traveling across the countries easier but also helps the member country to keep their economy sound and stable. This situation removes currency exchange cost, smooth international trade and consequently gives them more powerful voice in the world. A stable economy and larger area protects euro zone from external economic fluctuations, instability in currency market and unpredictable rise in oil prices.(euro2015ecb) "],
["factors-influencing-exchange-rate.html", "Factors influencing Exchange Rate", " Factors influencing Exchange Rate The demand of any currency relative to its supply determines its price, just like any other commodity. For each possible price of a Norwegian Krone, there is a corresponding demand and supply to be exchanged with euro in the money market. When demand of krone equals its supply, the price it exhibit at some specific time is called its equilibrium exchange rate. Factors like inflation, interest rates, expectation and government policy affects the demand for any currency. But the supply is mostly in control of the central bank. In a floating exchange rate regime, the shift in demand (fig-fig:demandShift) and supply(fig-fig:supplyShift) function determines equilibrium exchange rate of any currency. Demand Shift and Exchange Rate Equilibrium Supply Shift and Exchange Rate Equilibrium Effect of shifts on demand and supply of currencies on their Exchange rates In case of demand shift, with constant currency supply, the exchange rate will suddenly rise to \\(e’_d\\) creating dead weight loss (also known as excess burden or allocative inefficiency which consequently pushes the supply from \\(Q\\_0\\) to \\(Q\\_1\\) creating a new equilibrium exchange rate at \\(e\\_1\\). In the similar fashion, if the market is over flooded with currency, shifting the supply function and creating dead weight loss, the exchange rate is pressed from \\(e\\_0\\) to create a new equilibrium at \\(e_1\\). In both the situation, the quantity supplied although being increased, the first one leads to a rise in exchange rate while the other leads to its fall. madura2012international suggested an equation consisting those macroeconomic factors that can affect the demand and supply of any currency and consequently the exchange rate as, \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{e} = f \\left(\\Delta \\text{INF}, \\Delta \\text{INT}, \\Delta \\text{INC}, \\Delta \\text{GC}, \\Delta \\text{EXP}\\right) \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(e\\): percentage change in spot exchange rate \\(\\Delta\\) INF: change in inflation differential between two countries (currencies) \\(\\Delta\\) INT: change in interest rate differential between two countries \\(\\Delta\\) INC: change in the income level differential between two countries \\(\\Delta\\) GC: change in government control \\(\\Delta\\) EXP: change in currency value expectations Inflation Inflation is the steady rise in overall price level, i.e. a decrease in the value of currency. In other words, more amount of money is needed to buy same goods than previous. Relative change in inflation has effect on exchange rate. For instance, an abrupt rise in the inflation in Norway relative to the Eurozone, Norwegian products becomes relatively expensive in terms of Norwegian Currency. On one hand, this would increase the demands for Eurozone goods, and consequently the demand for euro increases in the short run. On the other hand, expensive Norwegian goods becomes less attractive in Eurozone and therefore reduce the supply of euro purchasing Norwegian kroner. In figure – fig:inflationEffect, the demand function of Euro shift upward due to inflation of NOK, i.e. Eurozone goods are more attractive than Norwegian goods and the downward shift on supply function occurs as the customers are less interested in Norwegian products. As a result the value of Euro per NOK increases from 9.10 to 9.97, i.e Norwegian Krone deprecates against the Euro (madura2012international). Effect of inflation on Exchange Rate Equilibrium Statistics Norway prepares and publishes the official figures for inflation, the consumer price index (CPI) with base year at 1998. Since the real value of money is constantly declining, high inflation means that storing money is expensive. while low and stable inflation contributes to an efficient distribution of resources in a market economy (NorgesBank2007faq). Since this is an important factor that can influence exchange rate, data for CPI is obtained for this thesis from Norges bank. The time-series plot for CPI in figure-fig:tsCPI shows an steady increment over the time. Interest Rate Since Interest rate has impact on inflation and currency values, by manipulating it, central banks exert influence over both inflation and exchange rates. For example, a sudden increase in interest rate in Norway relative to Eurozone could have increase on investment of Eurozone in Norway with interest-bearing securities. The Eurozone investors wants to invest more in Norway which increases the demand for NOK in Eurozone. Due to stronger incentives, Norwegians also increase their domestic investment, as a result, the supply of NOK in currency market will reduce. The increase in Demand of NOK and decrease in its supply results a shift in exchange rate to lower level. The process is illustrated in figure – fig:intRateEffect. Effect of interest rate change in Exchange Rate]{Effect of Interest Rate change on Exchange Rate includes (a) Demand Shift: Due to increased interest rate in Norway, demand of Norwegian Krone increases creating a demand shift in demand function and (b) Supply Shift: The supply of Krone decrease as Norwegian increase their domestic investment creating a shortage of NOK in market. The influence of market interest rate flows through multiple channel such as demand channel, exchange Rate channel and expectation Channel as shown in figure-fig:mrktRateInfluence (intRateEffect:2004NB). Market Rate influence on demand channel, exchange rate channel and expectation channel According to madura2012international, change in interest rate in third country can also affect the exchange rates between NOK and Euro. For instance, the sudden increase of interest rate in US would shift the European investment from Norway to US which consequently reduce the demand of NOK resulting a downward pressure on its exchange rate with Euro. Since the interest rate is a key factor influencing exchange rate, the key interest rate of Norway and Eurozone along with the loan interest rate of Norway is considered in this thesis. The time series plot of these variables are in figure – fig:intRates. Due to simultaneous act of other variables, the plot does not exhibit any discrete relationship. However, the model fitted by the data collected suggest some in-depth understanding of this relationship which is analysed and presented in … . Income Levels The rise in real income level increases the consumption level. Relative income levels of a country is another factor which can affect the demand of imported goods which consequently affect exchange rate (madura2012international). For instance, if the income levels of people of euro zone rises, other factor being constant, the demand for foreign goods in euro zone may increase which can shift the demand function outward and subsequently increase the exchange rate (figure-fig:incEffect). Effect of change in relative income levels on exchange rate ceteris paribus. The example considered above is on the assumption of ceteris paribus, which in reality is not usual. The change in exchange rate due to income levels is also guided through the effect of income levels on interest rates and inflation. The increased income levels increase the consumption cause the economy to overheat. Central banks could increase interest rates to prevent overheating and increased inflation. Thus the relative change in income levels can affect exchange rates directly and indirectly (madura2012international). Government Control Government Control is the fourth factor madura2012international has considered that can influence foreign exchange rate. Government can influence exchange rate in many ways including, imposing foreign exchange barriers imposing foreign trade barriers intervening (buying and selling currencies) in the foreign exchange markets and affecting macro variables such as inflation, interest rates, and income levels Norges Bank could force the currency to depreciate by flooding the market with NOK (i.e increasing supply) if Norway wants to boost its exports. Similarly, the bank could used their foreign currency reserve to purchase NOK to rise its value. Such direct interventions make considerable impact on the exchange rate. As a indirect intervention, the government can influencing the underlying macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rate and income level (madura2012international). Expectations Response to new information in foreign exchange market is similar to other financial market. The current expectation for the future value is reflected in the exchange rate changes. Like in stock market, when a company publishes its prosperous financial statement, the stock price suddenly rises; the forex market also exhibit similar performance. For example, a news of increasing inflation in Norway cause currency traders to sell Norwegian Krone expecting a decrease in its future value. This expectation is immediately seen as a downward pressure on Norwegian Krone. The similar effect is obtained when speculator expects the currency to depreciate (madura2012international). "],
["balance-of-payment.html", "Balance of Payment", " Balance of Payment A person of one country need the currency of another country for various purposes such as trade of goods and services, foreign investment and travelling. The actual flow of currency from one country to another is in these forms of activities. The transaction of trade in terms of goods and services between specific countries is kept recorded as a form of balance of payment which can even have signal of possible shifts in exchange rate. Although international trade is possessed in various forms, the transaction of multiple currency is common in each of them. A country keeps these transactions with other countries as a form of Balance of Payments account. A balance of payment account maintains a systematic records of these transactions conducted at some specific time period between a home country and others (those countries with which the transactions are made). A balance of payment account of a country exhibit the size of its economic activities with rest of the world (appleyard2014international). Since Balance of Payment is a bookkeeping system for inter countries economic activities, the items with payments inward to the home country are credited while payments outward from the home country are debited. Exports, inflow of foreign investment, interest and dividends obtained from the investment made on foreign country by the home country are considered as credited items as they increase the inward flow of currency. Similarly, Imports, investment made on foreign countries, interest and dividends paid to foreign countries for their investment in home country are the items to be debited (appleyard2014international). Balance of payment can be classified into two broad categories – a) Current Account and b) Capital Account. The items that lies in these subcategories are illustrated in table below. Current Account Capital Account Payments for Merchandise and Services Factor Income Payments Transfer Payments Direct Foreign Investment Portfolio Investment Other Capital Investment Errors and Omissions and Reserves Balance of payment can be classified into two broad categories – (a) Current Account and (b) Capital Account. The items that lies in these subcategories are illustrated in table-(tab:bopComponents). Current Account Current account measures net imports and exports of a country. Imports and exports are divided into three sub categories -(a)Trade of goods, (b) Trade of services and (c) Income, which includes the interest and dividend payed to international firms operating within home country and interest and dividends earned from domestically owned firms abroad (krugman2006international). The current account balance is the difference between export and import. When export of a country exceed its import, there is current account surplus and when import exceed export there is a current account deficit. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Current Account}=\\text{Total Exports}-\\text{Total Imports} \\end{equation}\\] Above equation can also be expressed as a form of income and expenditure like in equation-(curAccBal2) which is the difference between Total National Income and Total Domestic consumption (krugman2006international). \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:curAccBal2} \\text{Current Account Balance}= \\underbrace{\\text{Y}}_\\text{GNP}- \\underbrace{\\left(\\text{C}+\\text{I}+\\text{G}\\right)}_{\\substack{\\text{Total Domestic}\\\\\\text{Consumption}}} \\end{equation}\\] where, C = I = G = Current account incorporates a wide range of international transactions so there is a vital role of exchange rate in each of those transaction. This thesis has considered the monthly data for imports and exports of goods which is available from Statistics Norway. In Norway, current balance is highly influence by the balance in goods. Figure-(fig:curBal) shows that the balance in services in Norway is decreasing while the balance in Goods has boost up after around 1998. Further, the balance in services plotted in the same figure from the quarterly data exhibit a seasonal trend which is usual in Norway. Imports Machinery &amp; equipment, chemicals, metals and food stuffs are major imports of Norway. Sweden (13.6%), Germany (12.4%), China (9.3%), Denmark (6.3%), UK (6.1%) and US (5.4%) are major import partners (Source: cia.gov). The monthly imports of new ships (ImpNewShip), oil platform (ImpOilPlat), old ships (ImpOldShip) and all other items excluding ship and oil platform (ImpExShipOilPlat) are considered as predictor variable in data analysis. The time-series plot for these variables are presented in figure-(fig:tsPlotImp) Exports Norway is richly endowed with natural resources – petroleum, hydro-power, fish, forests, and minerals but the economy is highly dependent on the petroleum sector (Source:cia.gov). Petroleum products, machinery and equipment, metals, chemicals, ships and fishes are major exports of Norway (Source:cia.gov). The monthly time series for the Export of condensed fuel (ExpCond), crude oil (ExpCrdOil), natural gas (ExpNatGas), new ships (ExpNewShip), oil platform (ExpOilPlat), old ships (ExpOldShip) and all other exports excluding ships and oil platforms (ExpExShipOilPlat) are presented in figure-(fig:tsPlotExp). -->"]
